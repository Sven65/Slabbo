# Default suggested prices and quantities for items
#
# This file is used by Slabbo to provide suggested buy/sell prices and quantities for items when creating shops.
#
# You can override or add to this file as needed. Only items listed here will have suggestions.
#
# NOTE: Shops support decimals for buy/sell price, but quantity must be a full number (no decimals).
#
# IMPORTANT: The allowCents option in config.yml controls whether decimals are allowed for prices.
# If allowCents is false, all suggested buy/sell prices will be rounded to the nearest integer automatically.
#
# To override a suggestion, simply edit the value for that item. To add a new suggestion, add a new item entry.
#
# Item names must match the Bukkit Material enum names (see: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html)
